# MealPlannerMicroserviceA

Right now, the microservice is functional in a limited capacity. To test it, open the project in VScode and execute the "npm run server" command. Then, from your file system open another terminal and execute "npm run client". You should get some debugging messages and the final response should also be printed out. You can go into the test file and edit the request that is sent, testing new user and returning user, both should work. After sending a request with a valid new user, a new username and hashed password should be stored in the mongo database.
